### Project Title
Cards game - higher - lower

### Project Concept
It is two player game. Each player takes turn and draws one card at a time and places on the table face up. If the card drawn is bigger than the previous card on the table the player who drew the bigger card takes the pile on the table. Game continues until we run out of cards and whoever gathers bigger pile wins the game.

### Libraries we are planning to use
